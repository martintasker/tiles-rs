# Tiles

Our aim is to

* learn Rust
* generate Spectre and Hat tilings
* generate Penrose tilings

It's going to be quite a journey.  We'll start small.

To run:

```sh
cargo run
```

Then observe the output SVG in some preview or browser (or here).

![Spectre](./out-spectre.svg)
![Hexagons](./out12.svg)
![Octagons](./out8.svg)

See [release notes](./RELEASES.md).
